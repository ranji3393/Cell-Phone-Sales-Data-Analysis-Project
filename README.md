Cell Phone Sales Data Analysis Project



Iâ€™m excited to share my SQL project completed during training. The goal of the "Cell Phone Sales Data" project was to derive actionable insights from the data.



Project Objective :



1. Sales Trends: Identifying changes in sales patterns over time.

2. Top-performing Models and Manufacturers: Analyzing which models and manufacturers were the most popular.

3. Customer Purchasing Behavior: Understanding the preferences and habits of customers.

4. Price Analytics: Analyzing pricing trends, including the lowest and average prices of models across different manufacturers.



Techniques Used:



1. Data Retrieval and Filtering:

          SELECT Statements: Extracted data from DIM_CUSTOMER, DIM_LOCATION, DIM_MODEL, and FACT_TRANSACTIONS.

          WHERE Clauses: Refined data by criteria like year, manufacturer, and country.



2. Data Aggregation:

          GROUP BY: Aggregated data by models, states, or years for sales analysis.

          Aggregate Functions:

                            COUNT(): Counted transactions per model or state.

                            SUM(): Calculated total sales.

                            AVG() and ROUND(): Computed average sales prices, ensuring clarity.



3. Joining Tables:

          INNER JOIN: Combined related tables to analyze sales distribution and model performance.



4. Ranking and Window Functions:

         DENSE_RANK(): Ranked products/customers by sales volume.

         LAG(): Compared year-on-year sales for trend identification.



5. Data Sorting:

         ORDER BY: Sorted data to rank top-selling models and customers.



6. Set Operations:

          UNION and INTERSECT: Identified top-selling models across multiple years.



7. Date Functions:

          DATEPART() and YEAR(): Analyzed sales trends over time for deeper insights.



Achievements:



1. Top Purchasing States: Identified states with the highest customer purchases since 2005, offering geographic sales insights.

2. Leading Manufacturer: Determined Samsung as the top cell phone manufacturer in the US over multiple years.

3. Transaction Analysis: Analyzed transaction volumes by model, zip code, and state for regional and product-specific insights.

4. Price Insights: Found the cheapest cell phone model and assessed average prices among the top five manufacturers.

5. Customer Spending Behavior: Identified high-spending customers in 2009 and analyzed their purchasing habits.

6. Sales Consistency: Highlighted models that ranked among the top sellers from 2008 to 2010.

7. Manufacturer Activity: Noted manufacturers active in 2010 but not in 2009, indicating market shifts.
